In this project I have used NTLK and Spacy library for text cleaning purpose, to understand the text data I created a more intuitive word cloud using PIL library.To extract feature from the data I used TF-IDF algorithm. On training the Linear SVC I get the accuracy of 99.358%.

Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)

Feature extraction using TF-IDF / CountVectorizer

Multiple classification models

Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization
